I hope the above notice will prove to any judge that I, in fact, had a stoke while
writing this software and thus cannot be held liable for my own action, I don't
know what I'm doing and I shouldn't even be allowed a computer in the first place.

In the Event where Nintendo were to sue me (or even send me a strongly worded
letter let's be honest). The right is reserved for the author to be nintendo's
little bitch, remove the current Software distribution, revoke all previously
given licenses (INCLUDING THIS FILE) and hack into your machine by any mean
possible to remove any existing copies of the Software from the face of the earth.

I LOVE YOU NINTENDO-SAMA PLEASE DON'T SUE ME, I WILL REMOVE THE SOFTWARE AT ANY
POINT YOU JUST NEED TO ASK. I AM YOUR LITTLE BITCH AND WILL DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.
